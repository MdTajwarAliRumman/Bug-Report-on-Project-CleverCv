## 📌 Project Summary

Clever CV is an **AI-powered web platform** designed to help users easily create **professional resumes and cover letters**.  
The project focuses on simplifying the job application process by using **intelligent automation** to generate well-structured, visually appealing, and **ATS-friendly (Applicant Tracking System)** documents.

Users can input their personal and career details, and the system tailors the content and formatting to match **modern recruitment standards**.  
Its main goal is to make career presentation **accessible and effective for everyone** — especially for those who may not have strong design or writing skills.

By combining **user-friendly templates, smart AI suggestions**, and **fast export options**, Clever CV aims to empower job seekers to **stand out confidently** in the competitive job market.

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives

From the messaging on the site, the primary goals & objectives seem to be:

- 💡 **Goal:** Help job-seekers stand out with confidence by providing high-quality, professionally-designed CVs and cover letters.  

- 🎨 **Objective 1:** Make it quick and easy for a user to create, optimise, and export a resume – even if they don’t have design skills or deep experience in job-application writing.  

- 🤖 **Objective 2:** Leverage AI to personalise and tailor the document(s) to the user’s career goals and the job market — so the user isn’t just filling a generic template, but getting something aligned with what employers expect.  

- ✉️ **Objective 3:** Provide cover letters along with resumes — addressing a common pain point for applicants. The site mentions “AI guidance—personalised for your career goals and tailored to the job market.”  

- 💰 **Objective 4:** Offer monetisation via pricing plans (e.g., “Choose Your Plan” page) — another objective is to sustain the service commercially.
